In this scientific endeavor, a comprehensive flower image dataset serves as the bedrock for the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for class prediction. The dataset, meticulously curated to encapsulate diverse floral specimens, acts as the empirical foundation for the subsequent phases of the project.
